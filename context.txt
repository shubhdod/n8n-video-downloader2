This backend is built for a video downloader site that uses yt-dlp to process URLs from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and more.

It accepts POST requests to the /download endpoint with the following parameters:
- url: the video or reel URL to be processed
- type: either video or audio
- quality: the desired quality (e.g., best, worst, or format code)

ðŸ§  The backend is powered by:
- Flask (Python web server)
- yt-dlp (an advanced video downloading tool)
- Render.com (24/7 hosting with Docker support)

âœ… Example request (POST):
{
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example",
  "type": "video",
  "quality": "best"
}

âœ… Example response:
{
  "output": "https://download-link.mp4",
  "error": ""
}

- If you see a 429: Too Many Requests error from YouTube, yt-dlp may need browser cookies.
- This API is designed to be lightweight and scalable for web-based video downloaders.
